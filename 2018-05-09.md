Enom Central Customers:

I want to inform you that Enom recently became the subject of what appears to be a very sophisticated attack by a group that targets large internet infrastructure companies. Within hours of this attack, we were in contact with federal law enforcement and the affected parties. This attack hijacked the DNS traffic of 4 domains for a very short period of time before we mitigated the situation.

You have not been impacted by this incident and you are not required to take any action to ensure your future security. However, in an effort to continue to strive for transparency and best in class services, I wanted to inform you of this unfortunate situation.

To be clear, no domain names were stolen, and after exhaustive analysis, with the exception of the DNS of the domains specifically targeted, we do not have any evidence or reason to believe that these malicious actors accessed any customer accounts, customer personal information, or any of Enomâ€™s secured and encrypted data. Your security is a leading priority at Enom and we continue to work both with federal law enforcement and industry leading security forensic companies to protect your online presence.

I know you trust Enom Central with your domain names and services and we take this responsibility very seriously. We appreciate your business and you have our commitment to continue to do what it takes to protect your assets.
