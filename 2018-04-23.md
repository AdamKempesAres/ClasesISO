process-forest is a tool that processes Microsoft Windows EVTX event logs that contain process accounting events and reconstructs the historical process heirarchies. That is, it displays the parent-child relationships among programs. When using this tool during an incident response engagement, identifying a reverse shell process quickly leads to the processes launched by the operator, and insight into how it may be maintaining persistence.
